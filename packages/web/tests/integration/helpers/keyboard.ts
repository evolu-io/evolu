// NOTE, on MacOS, keyboard shortcuts like ⌘ A -> Select All do not work. See #1313
// https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/1313
// tldr; We can not use ⌘ for anything, not even for moving to line / page ends, etc.
// Meta works only in Linux and Windows and there are also different shortcuts.
// We rely on native text writing and selection anyway, because that's what
// contentEditable does well. If not, add platform and browser-specific test.
// Therefore, for key navigation, we use arrows only.
// There will be platform dependent edge cases among elements etc. That's fine.
